        <p>You are trapped in a prison cell, handcuffed to the bed by a <strong>four-digit padlock</strong>. To your left, you see a grimey mirror, and on the wall to your right the word 'LOSE' etched in vertical and horizontal lines.</p>

        <p>You remove the handcuffs and walk to the cell door. A three-digit code this time! Peering through the bars, you spot a brochure on the guard's desk: "We've got a number of items inside! Weights, Smartphones, Artworks, and much more!"</p>

        <p>You slip out of your cell and make your way to the Fire Exit, skilfully evading the guards. You are confronted by a final <strong>three-digit passcode</strong> and a poster that says "Initial Guard Rota: Oliver Neil Edwards, Simon Isaac Xavier, Thomas William Olson"</p>
